# Prodigy-Machine-Learning-Internship-Tasks

This repository contains the tasks completed during my Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The internship provided a hands-on learning experience with core machine learning concepts, algorithms, and real-world datasets. Each task involved implementing models, preprocessing data, and analyzing results with industry-standard tools.

ðŸ“Œ Tasks Overview:
Task 01: Linear Regression for House Price Prediction
Built a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
Dataset: House Prices â€“ Kaggle

Task 02: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Implemented K-Means clustering to group retail store customers based on their purchase history.
Dataset: Customer Segmentation â€“ Kaggle

Task 03: Image Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Developed an SVM-based image classifier to distinguish between cats and dogs using extracted features.
Dataset: Dogs vs. Cats â€“ Kaggle

Task 04: Food Image Classification and Calorie Estimation
Created a deep learning model to classify food items from images and estimate their calorie content to help users monitor their diet.
Dataset: Food-101 â€“ Kaggle

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras)
Jupyter Notebook
OpenCV / PIL (for image processing)
Kaggle Datasets
CNNs for image classification
