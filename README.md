# Prodigy-Machine-Learning-Internship-Tasks

This repository contains the tasks completed during my Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The internship provided a hands-on learning experience with core machine learning concepts, algorithms, and real-world datasets. Each task involved implementing models, preprocessing data, and analyzing results with industry-standard tools.

ðŸ“Œ Tasks Overview:

Task 01: Linear Regression for House Price Prediction
Built a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
